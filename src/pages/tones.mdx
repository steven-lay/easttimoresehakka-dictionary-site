## What's a tone?

As with other Chinese languages, Hakka is a tonal language. Tonal languages
rely on pitch and change in pitch to distinguish one word from another. For
example, *mai* can mean either buy or sell, completely opposite things, 
depending on which tone you pronounce it with. The number of tones varies
between each Chinese language, with Cantonese having either 6 or 9 tones
depending on classification and Mandarin having 4 tones. As with Meixian Hakka
and many other variants of Hakka, East Timorese Hakka has 6 tones. It's normal
for heritage and native speakers of Hakka to completely not know about tones as
it comes naturally for those groups of people.

## Tone notation

As there are six tones in East Timorese Hakka, the numbers 1 through to 6 
written in superscript are used to denote each tone respectively. To represent
the pitch of each of these tones, a system that utilises the numbers 1
through to 5 is used, with convention stating that 1 is assigned to be the
lowest pitch and 5 assigned to be the highest pitch. Tones can be rising - 
moving from a lower pitch to a higher pitch, level - flat throughout the whole
syllable, or falling - moving from a higher pitch to a lower pitch.
An example of pitch contour is the number 24, which represents a rising tone. 
This pitch change is similar to when "Huh?" is said in English with the 
intonation of confusion. The pitch scale is not absolute, but relative to one's 
own voice. A chart and table illustrating each of the six tones in East Timorese 
Hakka can be seen below:

| Tone number | Tone contour |   Description   |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| 1      | 33           | Mid flat        |
| 2      | 11           | Low flat        |
| 3      | 31           | Mid falling     |
| 4      | 55           | High flat       |
| 5      | 21           | Mid-Low falling |
| 6      | 33           | Mid flat        |

### Description of the tones

- **First tone** - flat and pronounced at the middle of the voice range
- **Second tone** - also flat, but is pronounced at the lower end of the voice range
- **Third tone** - is classified as mid falling: that is, it begins from the middle 
  of the voice range and dips to the lowest level
- **Fourth tone** - flat, but pronounced at the highest end of the voice range
- **Fifth tone** - low-mid falling: it starts lower than the third tone and then 
  ends at the lowest point of the voice range
- **Sixth tone** - pitch is identical to first tone's except the duration is shorter

## Tone Sandhi

Think tones aren't complex enough? Well there is also a phenomonon known as Tone
Sandhi. Tone Sandhi is a phenomenon where a tone of a syllable can change based 
on the tones of adjacent words. By convention, Tone Sandhi is not shown and the 
rules must be memorised in order to speak Hakka correctly. Luckily, there are 
only two Tone Sandhi rules in East Timorese Hakka. In both instances, the first 
tone changes from a mid flat tone to a rising tone (with tone contour 24) when 
followed by a falling tone - i.e. tone 3 and 5. Tone Sandhi rules must be 
followed to sound more fluent and natural. Recorded voice samples can be played
on the following table so the difference can be more easily heard:
