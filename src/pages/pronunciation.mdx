# Pronunciation

## How are Hakka words spelt?

Is it "*ngi hor mor*" or "*ngee ho mo*"? A lot of heritage speakers may know how 
to speak Hakka, but will not have any idea how to write it down and resort to
using letters that approximate the sounds in Hakka. One main issue is there can 
be many letters that can represent a specific sound and there is no right or 
wrong way! The way something can be written can vary strongly between person to
person. 

*What's needed is a standard way to write things to maintain consistency in place of ad-hoc romanisation madness.*

Numerous romanisation schemes have already been developed for different 
varieties of Hakka, including:

- Hakka Transliteration Scheme (客家話拼音方案), used for Meixian Hakka
- Phak-fa-su (白話字), used for numerous variants of Hakka spoken in Taiwan
- Hagfa Pinyim (客家話拼音)

No romanisation scheme exists for East Timorese Hakka. However, since most East
Timorese Chinese have ancestry from Meixian, the Hakka spoken by the East 
Timorese Chinese would be similar to the variant spoken in their ancestral 
lands. Therefore, a romanisation scheme which is essentially a modified version 
of the Hakka Transliteration Scheme will be used on the website. Modifications 
were necessary as the phonology of East Timorese Hakka has diverged from Meixian 
Hakka. The International Phoenetic Alphabet (IPA) is also used in this section
to notate sounds.

## Basic theory

The basic unit of sound in Hakka (and other Chinese languages in general) is the
syllable, which can usually be represented by a corresponding Chinese character
and also carries it's own specific meaning. A syllable consists of three
components:

<p style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>Syllable = (Initial) + Final + Tone number</p>

Initials are consonants which may be found at the start of a Hakka syllable,
whilst finals sounds contain a vowel and can be found at the end of a syllable,
or may be the actual syllable itself. Tones will be discussed at a later 
section. By combining these three components, an accurate representation of the 
pronunciation can be made. Let's have a look at an example:

The word *sam^1^* (三) meaning 'three' can be broken down into the three 
components:

- s - Intial
- am - Final
- 3 - Tone number

Here are a few examples of words written in Romanisation:

- ho^3^ kon^4^ <br/> Good Looking
- o^4^ zu^1^ <br/> Australia
- men^4^ bau^1^ <br/> Bread


There are a total of 20 initials, 65 finals and 6 tones in East Timorese Hakka. 
We will first look at initials and finals. Below you will find the tables of all 
the initials and finals in East Timorese Hakka.

<PhonoTable colTitles={['Initial', 'IPA', 'Example', 'Comments']} data={initials}/>

## Table of finals

<PhonoTable colTitles={['Final', 'IPA', 'Example', 'Comments']} data={finals}/>

### Notes

When there is a final beginning with i (iau, ia etc.) that has no intial, the i 
is replaced with a y unless the final is i itself.

For example:

- **i^3^** is written as **yi^3^**
- **iap^6^** is written as **yap^6^**
